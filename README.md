# IoT Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Project

This project measures the distance of an object using an **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** and a **microcontroller (ESP8266/ESP32)**.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- ESP8266 / ESP32
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- Arduino IDE(data to see Serial Monitor)

## ⚙️ Working
1. The ultrasonic sensor sends and receives sound waves.
2. The time taken is used to calculate distance.
3. The measured value is displayed or uploaded to ThingSpeak.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/code` → Arduino code files  
- `/circuit diagram` → Circuit image  
- `/certificatelot` → Project certificate
